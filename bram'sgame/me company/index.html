<p>the me company is an inovative idea where you can either post yourself
and someone will notify you that they need you for something under two hours. You can also be the
person buying a person for their services for a certain amount of time and money. when you post yourself
you tag what your services are and people willl maybe need one or two of your services. Payment depends
on how long the person providing service stay and what the are doing for you.</p>
